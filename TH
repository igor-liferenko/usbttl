SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idProduct}=="204b", ATTRS{idVendor}=="03eb", MODE:="0666"
Result: seeing avrterm while starting qemu shows that all is clear
NOTE: reflash before starting qemu
NOTE: when "poweroff" in qemu is run, avrterm shows garbage (??? - check again, maybe also it matters if superbuild is used which is normal or with garbage in avrterm)

in snapshot (kernel 4.14.37): all is clear

conclusion: either it is bug in debian or it is fault of kernel > 4.14.37
