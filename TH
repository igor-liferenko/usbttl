#1:
understand what happens when we set 9600 in avrterm and do "cat /dev/ttyACM0" in qemu and in avrter
m type characters - why when we press enter they appear in avrterm?

#2:
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idProduct}=="204b", ATTRS{idVendor}=="03eb", MODE:="0666"
NOTE: reflash _before_ starting qemu - do not reflash while qemu is running
NOTE: when "poweroff" in qemu is run, avrterm shows garbage (??? - check again)
After you check above, remove this file - do not use qemu to test avr firmware, because you will need to reboot qemu after each reflash.

NOTE: run ./build-x86.sh before testing and revert commits 7c599b8c145cdc3babf2492bdadfe9ab8d3084d4 and c02d15bf6f106d40a4ab8e2b88502705c191ebae in th/ after you finish testing
