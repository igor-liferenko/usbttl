SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idProduct}=="204b", ATTRS{idVendor}=="03eb", MODE:="0666"
testing on th/ will not work - after power reset on AVR, computer reinumerates the device so settings
in qemu stop working (it is determined by host), and setting device number in qemu
in advance does not work (when the device is not connected yet):
qemu-system-x86_64: -device usb-host,hostbus=3,hostaddr=23: failed to find host usb device 3:23
