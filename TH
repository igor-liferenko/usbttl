Result: seeing avrterm while starting qemu shows that all is clear
NOTE: reflash _before_ starting qemu - do not reflash while qemu is running
NOTE: when "poweroff" in qemu is run, avrterm shows garbage (??? - check again, maybe also it matters if superbuild is used which is normal or with garbage in avrterm)

Do not use qemu to test avr firmware, because you will need to reboot qemu after each reflash.
