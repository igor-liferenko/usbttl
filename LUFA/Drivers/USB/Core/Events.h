 *  \brief USB Event management definitions.
 *
 *  This module contains macros and functions relating to the management of library events, which are small
 *  pieces of code similar to ISRs which are run when a given condition is met. Each event can be fired from
 *  multiple places in the user or library code, which may or may not be inside an ISR, thus each handler
 *  should be written to be as small and fast as possible to prevent possible problems.
 *
 *  Events can be hooked by the user application by declaring a handler function with the same name and parameters
 *  listed here. If an event with no user-associated handler is fired within the library, it by default maps to an
 *  internal empty stub function.
 *
 *  Each event must only have one associated event handler, but can be raised by multiple sources by calling the
 *  event handler function (with any required event parameters).

			/** Event for USB device connection. This event fires when the microcontroller is in USB Device mode

			 *  level on the microcontroller's VBUS sense pin.
			 *
			 *  This event is time-critical; exceeding OS-specific delays within this event handler (typically of around
			 *  two seconds) will prevent the device from enumerating correctly.
			 *
			 *  \attention This event may fire multiple times during device enumeration on the microcontrollers with limited USB controllers
			 *             if \c NO_LIMITED_CONTROLLER_CONNECT is not defined.
			 *
			 *  \note For the microcontrollers with limited USB controller functionality, VBUS sensing is not available.
			 *        this means that the current connection state is derived from the bus suspension and wake up events by default,
			 *        which is not always accurate (host may suspend the bus while still connected). If the actual connection state
			 *        needs to be determined, VBUS should be routed to an external pin, and the auto-detect behavior turned off by
			 *        passing the \c NO_LIMITED_CONTROLLER_CONNECT token to the compiler via the -D switch at compile time. The connection
			 *        and disconnection events may be manually fired, and the \ref USB_DeviceState global changed manually.

			/** Event for control requests. This event fires when a the USB host issues a control request

			 *  request that the library may have a handler code for internally, or a class specific request
			 *  issued to the device which must be handled appropriately. If a request is not processed in the
			 *  user application via this event, it will be passed to the library for processing internally
			 *  if a suitable handler exists.
			 *
			 *  This event is time-critical; each packet within the request transaction must be acknowledged or

			 *  The library internally handles all standard control requests with the exceptions of SYNC FRAME,
