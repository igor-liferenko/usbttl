@** Data throughput, latency and handshaking issues.
The Universal Serial Bus may be new to some users and developers. Here are
described the major architecture differences that need to be considered by both software and
hardware designers when changing from a traditional RS232 based solution to one that uses
the USB to serial interface devices.

@* The need for handshaking.
USB data transfer is prone to delays that do not normally appear in systems that have been used
to transferring data using interrupts. The original COM ports of a PC were directly connected
to the
motherboard and were interrupt driven. When a character was transmitted or received (depending
if FIFO's are used) the CPU would be interrupted and go to a routine to handle the data. This
meant that a user could be reasonably certain that, given a particular baud rate and data rate,
the
transfer of data could be achieved without any real need for flow control. The hardware interrupt
ensured that the request would get serviced. Therefore data could be transferred without using
handshaking and still arrive into the PC without data loss.

@* Data transfer comparison.
USB does not transfer data using interrupts. It uses a scheduled system and as a result, there can
be periods when the USB request does not get scheduled and, if handshaking is not used, data
loss will occur. An example of scheduling delays can be seen if an open application is dragged
around using the mouse.

For a USB device, data transfer is done in packets. If data is to be sent from the PC, then a
packet
of data is built up by the device driver and sent to the USB scheduler. This scheduler puts the
request onto the list of tasks for the USB host controller to perform. This will typically take
at least
1 millisecond to execute because it will not pick up the new request until the next 'USB Frame'
(the
frame period is 1 millisecond). Therefore there is a sizable overhead (depending on your required
throughput) associated with moving the data from the application to the USB device. If data were
sent 'a byte at a time' by an application, this would severely limit the overall throughput of the
system as a whole.

@* Continuous data --- smoothing the lumps.
Data is received from USB to the PC by a polling method. The driver will request a certain amount
of data from the USB scheduler. This is done in multiples of 64 bytes. The 'bulk packet size' on
USB is a maximum of 64 bytes. The host controller will read data from the device until either:

a) a packet shorter than 64 bytes is received or
b) the requested data length is reached

The device driver will request packet sizes between 64 Bytes and 4 Kbytes. The size of the packet
will affect the performance and is dependent on the data rate. For very high speed, the largest
packet size is needed. For 'real-time' applications that are transferring audio data at 115200 Baud
for example, the smallest packet possible is desirable, otherwise the device will be holding up
4k of
data at a time. This can give the effect of 'jerky' data transfer if the USB request size is too
large
and the data rate too low (relatively).

@* Small amounts of data or end of buffer conditions.
When transferring data from a USB-Serial or USB-FIFO IC device to the PC, the device will
send the data given one of the following conditions:

1. The buffer is full (64 bytes made up of 2 status bytes and 62 user bytes).

2. One of the RS232 status lines has changed (USB-Serial chips only). A change of level (high
or low) on CTS\# / DSR\# / DCD\# or RI\# will cause it to pass back the current buffer even
though it may be empty or have less than 64 bytes in it.

3. An event character had been enabled and was detected in the incoming data stream.

4. A timer integral to the chip has timed out. There is a timer (latency timer) in some
chips that measures the time since data was last
sent to the PC. The default value of the timer is set to 16 milliseconds.
The value of the timer is adjustable from 1 to 255 milliseconds.
Every time data is
sent back to the PC the timer is reset. If it times-out then the chip will send back the 2 status
bytes and any data that is held in the buffer.

From this it can be seen that small amounts of data (or the end of large amounts of data), will be
subject to a 16 millisecond delay when transferring into the PC. This delay should be taken along
with the delays associated with the USB request size as mentioned in the previous section. The
timer value was chosen so that we could make advantage of 64 byte packets to fill large buffers
when in high speed mode, as well as letting single characters through. Since the value chosen for
the latency timer is 16 milliseconds, this means that it will take 16 milliseconds to receive an
individual character, over and above the transfer time on serial or parallel link.

For large amounts of data, at high data rates, the timer will not be used. It may be used to send
the last packet of a block, if the final packet size works out to be less than 64 bytes. The
first 2
bytes of every packet are used as status bytes for the driver. This status is sent every 16
milliseconds, even when no data is present in the device.

A worst case condition could occur when 62 bytes of data are received in 16 milliseconds. This
would not cause a timeout, but would send the 64 bytes (2 status + 62 user data bytes) back to
USB every 16 milliseconds. When the USB driver receives the 64 bytes it would hold on
to them and request another 'IN' transaction. This would be completed another 16 milliseconds
later and so on until USB driver gets all of the 4K of data required. The overall time would
be (4096 / 64) * 16 milliseconds = 1.024 seconds between data packets being received by the
application. In
order to stop the data arriving in 4K packets, it should be requested in smaller amounts. A short
packet (< 64 bytes) will of course cause the data to pass from USB driver back to the chip
driver for
use by the application.

For application programmers it must be stressed that data should be sent or received using buffers
and not individual characters.

@** Effect of USB buffer size and the latency timer on data throughput.
An effect that is not immediately obvious is the way the size of the USB total packet request
has on
the smoothness of data flow. When a read request is sent to USB, the USB host controller will
continue to read 64 byte packets until one of the following conditions is met:

1. It has read the requested size (default is 4 Kbytes).

2. It has received a packet shorter than 64 bytes from the chip.

3. It has been cancelled.

While the host controller is waiting for one of the above conditions to occur, NO data is
received by
our driver and hence the user's application. The data, if there is any, is only finally
transferred after
one of the above conditions has occurred.

Normally condition 3 will not occur so we will look at cases 1 and 2. If 64 byte packets are
continually sent back to the host, then it will continue to read the data to match the block size
requested before it sends the block back to the driver. If a small amount of data is sent, or the
data is sent slowly, then the latency timer will take over and send a short packet back to the host
which will terminate the read request. The data that has been read so far is then passed on to the
users application via the chip driver. This shows a relationship between the latency timer,
the data
rate and when the data will become available to the user. A condition can occur where if data is
passed into the chip at such a rate as to avoid the latency timer timing out, it can take a long
time between receiving data blocks. This occurs because the host controller will see 64 byte
packets at the point just before the end of the latency period and will therefore continue to
read the
data until it reaches the block size before it is passed back to the user's application.

The rate that causes this will be:

62 / Latency Timer bytes/Second

(2 bytes per 64 byte packet are used for status)

For the default values: -

62 / 0.016 ~= 3875 bytes /second ~= 38.75 KBaud

Therefore if data is received at a rate of 3875 bytes per second (38.75 KBaud) or faster, then the
data will be subject to delays based on the requested USB block length. If data is received at a
slower rate, then there will be less than 62 bytes (64 including our 2 status bytes) available
after 16
milliseconds. Therefore a short packet will occur, thus terminating the USB request and passing
the data back. At the limit condition of 38.75 KBaud it will take approximately 1.06 seconds
between data buffers into the users application (assuming a 4Kbyte USB block request buffer size).

To get around this you can either increase the latency timer or reduce the USB block request.
Reducing the USB block request is the preferred method though a balance between the 2 may be
sought for optimum system response.

USB Transfer (buffer) size can be adjusted in the chip. Transmit buffer and receive buffer
are separate. TODO: read Dimitrov's arduino forum thread about this.
@^TODO@>

The size of the USB block requested can be adjusted in the chip.

@* Event Characters.
If the event character is enabled and it is detected in the data stream, then the contents of the
devices buffer is sent immediately. The event character is not stripped out of the data stream by
the device or by the drivers, it is up to the application to remove it. Event characters may
be turned
on and off depending on whether large amounts of random data or small command sequences are
to be sent. The event character will not work if it is the first character in the buffer. It
needs to be
the second or higher. The reason for this being applications that use the Internet for example,
will
program the event character as `\$7E'. All the data is then sent and received in packets that have
`\$7E' at the start and at the end of the packet. In order to maximise throughput and to avoid a
packet with only the starting `\$7E' in it, the event character does not trigger on the first
position.

@* Flushing the receive buffer using the modem status lines.
Flow control can be used by some chips to flush
the buffer in the chip. Changing one of the modem status lines will do this. The modem status
lines can be controlled by an external device or from the host PC itself. If an unused output line
(DTR) is connected to one of the unused inputs (DSR), then if the DTR line is changed by the
application program from low to high or high to low, this will cause a change on DSR and make it
flush the buffer.

@* Flow Control.
Some chips use their own handshaking as an
integral part of its design, by proper use of the TXE\# line. Such chips can use RTS/CTS,
DTR/DSR hardware or XOn/XOff software handshaking.
It is highly recommended that some form of handshaking be used.

There are 4 methods of flow control that can be programmed for some devices.

1. None - this may result in data loss at high speeds

2. RTS/CTS - 2 wire handshake. The device will transmit if CTS is active and will drop RTS if it
cannot receive any more.

3. DTR/DSR - 2 wire handshake. The device will transmit if DSR is active and will drop DTR if it
cannot receive any more.

4. XON/XOFF - flow control is done by sending or receiving special characters. One is XOn
(transmit on) the other is XOff (transmit off). They are individually programmable to any value.

It is strongly encouraged that flow control is used because it is impossible to ensure that the
chip
driver will always be scheduled. The chip can buffer up to 384 bytes of data. Kernel can 'starve'
the driver program of time if it is doing other things. The most obvious example of this is moving
an application around the screen with the mouse by grabbing its task bar. This will result in a lot
of
graphics activity and data loss will occur if receiving data at 115200 baud (as an example) with no
handshaking. If the data rate is low or data loss is acceptable then flow control may be omitted.

Event for USB device connection. This event fires when the microcontroller is in USB
Device mode
and the device is connected to a USB host, beginning the enumeration process measured
by a rising
level on the microcontroller's VBUS sense pin.

This event is time-critical; exceeding OS-specific delays within this event handler
(typically of around
two seconds) will prevent the device from enumerating correctly.

This event may fire multiple times during device enumeration on the
microcontrollers with limited USB controllers.

For the microcontrollers with limited USB controller functionality, VBUS sensing
is not available.
this means that the current connection state is derived from the bus suspension
and wake up events by default,
which is not always accurate (host may suspend the bus while still connected).
If the actual connection state
needs to be determined, VBUS should be routed to an external pin, and the
auto-detect behavior turned off (see \.{NO\_LIMITED\_CONTROLLER\_CONNECT} in git lg).
The connection

global changed manually.

@ Setting |U2X1| bit will reduce the divisor of the baud rate divider from 16 to 8,
effectively doubling the transfer rate. Note however that the Receiver will in this
case only use half the number of samples (reduced from 16 to 8) for data sampling
and clock recovery, and therefore a more accurate baud rate setting and system
clock are required when this mode is used. For the Transmitter, there are no downsides.

Using a CPU clock of 4 MHz, 9600 Bd can be achieved with an acceptable
tolerance without setting \.{U2X} (prescaler 25), while 38400 Bd
require \.{U2X} to be set (prescaler 12).

The USART Baud Rate Register (UBRR) and the down-counter connected to it functions
as a programmable prescaler or baud rate generator. The down-counter, running at
system clock ($F_{OSC}$), is loaded with the UBRR value each time the counter has counted
down to zero or when the UBRRL Register is written. A clock is generated each time
the counter reaches zero.

This clock is the baud rate generator clock output (= $F_{OSC}/(UBRR+1)$). The
transmitter divides the baud rate generator clock output by 2, 8, or 16 depending
on mode. The baud rate generator output is used directly by the receiver's clock
and data recovery units.

Below are the equations for calculating baud rate and UBRR value:

whereas bps = Bits/Second)

be chained
together; i.e. the entire stream data must be read or written at the one time.

@** USB.
The USB functionality.

@* Core driver for the microcontroller hardware USB module.

@*1 Driver and framework for the USB controller.
The USB stack requires the sole control over the USB controller in the microcontroller
only; i.e. it does not
require any additional timers or other peripherals to operate. This ensures that the USB
stack requires as few
resources as possible.

Here the USB stack is used in Device Mode for connections to USB Hosts.

@*2 USB Class Drivers.
Driver for the standardized CDC USB device class.

Class drivers give a framework which sits on top of the low level library API,
allowing for standard
USB classes to be implemented in a project with minimal user code.

These drivers can
be used in
conjunction with the library low level APIs to implement interfaces both via the
class drivers and via
the standard library APIs.

Multiple device mode class drivers can be used within a project, including multiple
instances of the
same class driver. In this way, USB Hosts and Devices can be made quickly using the
internal class drivers
so that more time and effort can be put into the end application instead of the USB protocol.

CDC-ACM class driver is used here.

@*1 Using the Class Drivers.
To make the Class drivers easy to integrate into a user application, they all
implement a standardized
design with similarly named/used function, enums, defines and types. The two different
modes are implemented
slightly differently, and thus will be explained separately. For information on a
specific class driver, read
the class driver's module documentation.

@*2 Device Mode Class Drivers.
Implementing a Device Mode Class Driver in a user application requires a number of steps
to be followed. Firstly,
the module configuration and state structure must be added to the project source.
These structures are named in a
similar manner between classes, that of |USB_ClassInfo_CDC_Device_t|,
and are used to hold the
complete state and configuration for each class instance. Multiple class instances is
where the power of the class
drivers lie; multiple interfaces of the same class simply require more instances of the
Class Driver's \&{USB\_ClassInfo\_*}
structure.

Inside the ClassInfo structure lies two sections, a |Config| section, and a
|State| section. The |Config| section contains the instance's configuration parameters.

@ LUFA CDC Class driver interface configuration and state information.
This structure is
passed to all CDC Class driver functions, so that multiple instances of the same class
within a device can be differentiated from one another.

Initialize instance (i.e., set \\{Config} field) of the CDC Class Driver structure.

Note, that the class driver's configuration parameters should match those used in the
device's descriptors that are sent to the host.

@<Global...@>=
USB_ClassInfo_CDC_Device_t VirtualSerial_CDC_Interface = {@|
  @<Initialize \\{Config} field of |USB_ClassInfo_CDC_Device_t|@>@/
};

@ @<Initialize \\{Config} field of |USB_ClassInfo_CDC_Device_t|@>= {@|
  INTERFACE_ID_CDC_CCI, @|
  {@, CDC_TX_EPADDR, CDC_TXRX_EPSIZE, 1 @,}, @|
  {@, CDC_RX_EPADDR, CDC_TXRX_EPSIZE, 1 @,}, @|
  {@, CDC_NOTIFICATION_EPADDR, CDC_NOTIFICATION_EPSIZE, 1 @,} @/
}

@ To initialize the Class driver instance, the driver's
|CDC_Device_ConfigureEndpoints| function
should be called in response to the |EVENT_USB_Device_ConfigurationChanged| event.
This function will return a
boolean true value if the driver successfully initialized the instance. Like all the
class driver functions, this function
takes in the address of the specific instance you wish to initialize
(this was done to be able to initialize multiple separate instances of the same class
type).

Event handler for USB configuration number change event.
This event fires when a the USB host changes the
selected configuration number while in device mode. This event should be hooked in device
applications to create the endpoints and configure the device for the selected configuration.

This event is time-critical; exceeding OS-specific delays within this event handler
(typically of around
one second) will prevent the device from enumerating correctly.

This event fires after the value of |USB_Device_ConfigurationNumber| has been changed.

@<Func...@>=
void EVENT_USB_Device_ConfigurationChanged(void);

@

@c
void EVENT_USB_Device_ConfigurationChanged(void)
{
  if (CDC_Device_ConfigureEndpoints(&VirtualSerial_CDC_Interface)) { /* USB interface is ready */
    PORTB |= 1 << 0;
    PORTD &= ~(1 << 5);
  }
  else { /* an error has occurred in the USB interface */
    PORTB |= 1 << 0;
    PORTD |= 1 << 5;
  }
}

@ Once initialized, it is important to maintain the CDC class instance state by repeatedly
calling the Class Driver's |CDC_Device_USBTask| function in the main program loop.

It needs to be called together with the main USB maintenance routine |USB_DeviceTask|.

@<Main program loop@>=
int main(void)
{
  DDRD |= 1 << PD7;
  PORTD |= 1 << PD7; /* |DTR| pin high */

  DDRB |= 1 << 0;
  DDRD |= 1 << 5;

  clock_prescale_set(clock_div_1); /* disable clock division */

  USB_Init();

#if 0
  TCCR0B = (1 << CS02); /* from arduino-usbserial; start the flush timer so that overflows occur
                           rapidly to push received bytes to the USB interface */
#endif

  RingBuffer_InitBuffer(&USBtoUSART_Buffer, USBtoUSART_Buffer_Data,
    sizeof USBtoUSART_Buffer_Data);
  RingBuffer_InitBuffer(&USARTtoUSB_Buffer, USARTtoUSB_Buffer_Data,
    sizeof USARTtoUSB_Buffer_Data);

  @<Enable global interrupt@>@;

  while (1) {
    @<Only try to read in bytes from the CDC interface if the transmit buffer...@>@;
    uint16_t BufferCount = RingBuffer_GetCount(&USARTtoUSB_Buffer);
    if (BufferCount) {
      Endpoint_SelectEndpoint(VirtualSerial_CDC_Interface.Config.DataINEndpoint.Address);
      @<Try to send more data@>@;
    }
    @<Load the next byte...@>@;

    CDC_Device_USBTask(&VirtualSerial_CDC_Interface);
    USB_DeviceTask();
  }
}

@ {\emergencystretch=2cm The final standardized Device Class Driver function is the Control
Request handler function
|CDC_Device_ProcessControlRequest|, which should be called when the
|EVENT_USB_Device_ControlRequest| event fires. This function should also be called for
each class driver instance, using the address of the instance to operate on as the function's
parameter. The request handler will abort if it is determined that the current request is not
targeted at the given class driver instance, thus these methods can safely be called
one-after-another in the event handler with no form of error checking.\par}

Event handler for USB Control Request reception event.
This event fires when a the USB host issues a control request
to the mandatory device control endpoint (of address 0). This may either be a standard
request that the library may have a handler code for internally, or a class specific request
issued to the device which must be handled appropriately. If a request is not processed in the
user application via this event, it will be passed to the library for processing internally
if a suitable handler exists.

This event is time-critical; each packet within the request transaction must be acknowledged or
sent within 50ms or the host will abort the transfer.

The library internally handles all standard control requests with the exceptions of SYNC FRAME,
SET DESCRIPTOR and SET INTERFACE. These and all other non-standard control requests
will be left
for the user to process via this event if desired. If not handled in the user application or by
the library internally, unknown requests are automatically STALLed.

Requests should be handled in the same manner as described in the USB 2.0 Specification,
or appropriate class specification. In all instances, the library has already read the
request SETUP parameters into the |USB_ControlRequest| structure which should then
be used by the application to determine how to handle the issued request.

NOTE: |EVENT_USB_Device_ControlRequest| fires before the [request?] [event?] handlers;
in \hfil\break \.{arduino-usbserial} it fires after [request?] [event?] handlers --- understand
if there is any difference. (this function is called slightly different name
in arduino-usbserial - see changelog in lufa tarball)

@<Func...@>=
void EVENT_USB_Device_ControlRequest(void);

@ @c
void EVENT_USB_Device_ControlRequest(void)
{
	CDC_Device_ProcessControlRequest(&VirtualSerial_CDC_Interface);
}

@ Class driver also defines a callback function |CALLBACK_USB_GetDescriptor|.
In addition, each class
driver may
also define a set of events (identifiable by their prefix of \\{EVENT\_*} in the
function's name), which
the user application may choose to implement, or ignore if not needed.

{\emergencystretch=2cm The individual Device Mode Class Driver documentation contains more
information on the
non-standardized,
class-specific functions which the user application can then use on the driver instances,
such as data
read and write routines. See each driver's individual documentation for more information
on the
class-specific functions.\par}

@* CompilerSpecific.
Compiler specific definitions for code optimization and correctness.

Compiler specific definitions to expose certain compiler features which may increase
the level of code optimization
for a specific compiler, or correct certain issues that may be present such as memory
barriers for use in conjunction
with atomic variable access.

Where possible, on alternative compilers, these macros will either have no effect, or
default to returning a sane value
so that they can be used in existing code without the need for extra compiler checks in
the user application code.

@ Forces GCC to create a memory barrier, ensuring that memory accesses are not reordered
past the barrier point.
This can be used before ordering-critical operations, to ensure that the compiler does
not re-order the resulting
assembly output in an unexpected manner on sections of code that are ordering-specific.

@<Macros@>=
#define GCC_MEMORY_BARRIER()                  __asm__ __volatile__("" ::: "memory");

@* Attributes.
Special function/variable attribute macros.

This contains macros for applying specific attributes to functions and variables
to control various optimizer and code generation features of the compiler.

@ Forces the compiler to inline the specified function. When applied, the given function will be
in-lined under all circumstances.

@<Macros@>=
#define ALWAYS_INLINE @t\hskip9pt@> __attribute__ @t\hskip-5pt@> ((always_inline))

alignment bytes usually added between fields to optimize field accesses.

@<Macros@>=
#define PACKED @t\hskip9pt@> __attribute__ @t\hskip-5pt@> ((packed))

@* Configuration.
Configure compile time options,
as an alternative to the compile time constants supplied through
the makefile.

@ By default, the library determines the size of the control endpoint by reading the device
descriptor. Normally this reduces the amount of configuration required for the library, allows
the value to change dynamically (if descriptors are stored in EEPROM or RAM rather than flash
memory) and reduces code maintenance. However, this token can be defined to a non-zero value
instead to give the size in bytes of the control endpoint, to reduce the size of the compiled
binary.

@<Macros@>=
#define FIXED_CONTROL_ENDPOINT_SIZE      8

@ By default, the library determines the number of configurations a USB device supports by
reading the device descriptor. This reduces the amount of configuration required to set up the
library, and allows the value to change dynamically (if descriptors are stored in EEPROM or RAM
rather than flash memory) and reduces code maintenance. However, this value may be fixed via this
token to reduce the compiled size of the binary at the expense of flexibility.

@<Macros@>=
#define FIXED_NUM_CONFIGURATIONS         1

@* Common.

@ Retrieves a mask which contains the current state of the global interrupts for the device. This
value can be stored before altering the global interrupt enable state, before restoring the
flag(s) back to their previous values after a critical section using
|@<Set global interrupt mask@>|.

@ Global indicating the maximum packet size of the default control endpoint located at address
0 in the device. This value is set to the value indicated in the device descriptor in the user
project once the USB interface is initialized into device mode.

If space is an issue, it is possible to fix this to a static value by defining the control
endpoint size in the |FIXED_CONTROL_ENDPOINT_SIZE| token passed to the compiler in the
makefile
via the -D switch. When a fixed control endpoint size is used, the size is no longer
dynamically
read from the descriptors at runtime and instead fixed to the given value. When used, it is
important that the descriptor control endpoint size value matches the size given as the
|FIXED_CONTROL_ENDPOINT_SIZE| token - it is recommended that the
|FIXED_CONTROL_ENDPOINT_SIZE| token
be used in the device descriptors to ensure this.

@* USBTask.
Main USB service task management.

This contains the function definitions required for the main USB service task,
which must be called to ensure that the USB connection to a connected USB device
is maintained.

@ Structure containing the last received Control request for use
inside of the \hfil\break |EVENT_USB_Device_ControlRequest| event.

@<Global variables@>=
USB_Request_Header_t USB_ControlRequest;

@ One of the most frequently used global variables in the stack is the |USB_DeviceState|
global, which indicates the current state of the Device State Machine. To reduce the
amount of code and time required to access and modify this global in an application,
|DEVICE_STATE_AS_GPIOR| may be defined to a value between 0 and 2 to fix the state
variable into one of the three general purpose IO registers inside the AVR reserved
for application use. So as it is defined, the corresponding |GPIOR| register should
not be used within the user application except implicitly via the library APIs.

@d DEVICE_STATE_AS_GPIOR 0

@<Macros@>=
#define CONCAT(x, y)            x ## y
#define CONCAT_EXPANDED(x, y)   CONCAT(x, y)
#define USB_DeviceState CONCAT_EXPANDED(GPIOR, DEVICE_STATE_AS_GPIOR) /* expands into
  |(*(volatile uint8_t *)((0x1E) + 0x20))| */

@* USB Event management.
This contains macros and functions relating to the management of library events, which
are small
pieces of code similar to ISRs which are run when a given condition is met. Each event
can be fired from
multiple places in the user or library code, which may or may not be inside an ISR, thus
each handler
should be written to be as small and fast as possible to prevent possible problems.

Events can be hooked by the user application by declaring a handler function with the
same name and parameters
listed here. If an event with no user-associated handler is fired within the library,
it by default maps to an
internal empty stub function.

Each event must only have one associated event handler, but can be raised by multiple
sources by calling the
event handler function (with any required event parameters).

@* StdDescriptors.
Common standard USB Descriptor definitions.
Standard USB device descriptor defines and retrieval routines. This contains
structures and macros for the easy creation of standard USB descriptors.

@ Indicates that a given descriptor does not exist in the device. This can be used inside
descriptors for string descriptor indexes, or may be use as a return value for
|CALLBACK_USB_GetDescriptor| when
the specified descriptor does not exist.

@<Macros@>=
#define NO_DESCRIPTOR 0

@ Macro to calculate the power value for the configuration descriptor, from a given number
of milliamperes.
Parameter is maximum number of milliamps the device consumes when the given
configuration is selected.

@<Macros@>=
#define USB_CONFIG_POWER_MA(mA) ((mA) >> 1)

@ Macro to calculate the Unicode length of a string with a given number of Unicode characters.
Should be used in string descriptor's headers for giving the string descriptor's byte length.

Parameter is number of Unicode characters in the string text.

@<Macros@>=
#define USB_STRING_LEN(UnicodeChars) (sizeof (USB_Descriptor_Header_t) + ((UnicodeChars) << 1))

@ Convenience macro to easily create |USB_Descriptor_String_t| instances from a wide
character string.

Parameter is string to initialize a USB String Descriptor structure with.

@<Macros@>=
#define USB_STRING_DESCRIPTOR(String) { \
  { \
    sizeof (USB_Descriptor_Header_t) + ( sizeof (String) - 2 ), \
    DTYPE_STRING \
  }, \
  String \
}

@ Macro to encode a given major/minor/revision version number into Binary Coded Decimal
format for descriptor
fields requiring BCD encoding, such as the USB version number in the standard device
descriptor.

Note, that this value is automatically converted into Little Endian, suitable for direct use
inside device descriptors without endianness conversion macros.

Parameters are: major version number to encode, minor version number to encode,
revision version number to encode.

@<Macros@>=
#define VERSION_BCD(Major, Minor, Revision) \
                                          ((Major & 0xFF) << 8) | \
                                                       ((Minor & 0x0F) << 4) | \
                                                       (Revision & 0x0F)

@*1 USB Configuration Descriptor Attribute Masks.

@ Mask for the reserved bit in the Configuration Descriptor's |ConfigAttributes| field,
which must be set on all devices for historical purposes.

@<Macros@>=
#define USB_CONFIG_ATTR_RESERVED          0x80

@ Can be masked with other configuration descriptor attributes for a
\hfil\break |USB_Descriptor_Config_Header_t|
descriptor's |ConfigAttributes| value to indicate that the specified configuration
can draw its power from the device's own power source.

@<Macros@>=
#define USB_CONFIG_ATTR_SELFPOWERED 0x40

@*1 Endpoint Descriptor Attribute Masks.

@ Can be masked with other endpoint descriptor attributes for a
|USB_Descriptor_Endpoint_t| descriptor's
|Attributes| value to indicate that the specified endpoint is not synchronized.

See the USB specification for more details on the possible Endpoint attributes.

@<Macros@>=
#define ENDPOINT_ATTR_NO_SYNC (0 << 2)

@*1 Endpoint Descriptor Usage Masks.

@ Can be masked with other endpoint descriptor attributes for a
|USB_Descriptor_Endpoint_t| descriptor's
|Attributes| value to indicate that the specified endpoint is used for data transfers.

See the USB specification for more details on the possible Endpoint usage attributes.

@<Macros@>=
#define ENDPOINT_USAGE_DATA               (0 << 4)

@* CDC Class driver.

There are several major drawbacks to the CDC-ACM standard USB class, however
it is very standardized and thus usually available as a built-in driver on
most platforms, and so is a better choice than a proprietary serial class.

One major issue with CDC-ACM is that it requires two Interface descriptors,
which will upset most hosts when part of a multi-function "Composite" USB
device. This is because each interface will be loaded into a separate driver
instance, causing the two interfaces be become unlinked. To prevent this, you
should use the "Interface Association Descriptor" addendum to the USB 2.0 standard
which is available on most OSes when creating Composite devices.

Another major oversight is that there is no mechanism for the host to notify the
device that there is a data sink on the host side ready to accept data. This
means that the device may try to send data while the host isn't listening, causing
lengthy blocking timeouts in the transmission routines. It is thus highly recommended
that the virtual serial line DTR (Data Terminal Ready) signal be used where possible
to determine if a host application is ready for data.

@ Retrieves the current number of bytes stored in a particular buffer. This value is computed
by entering an atomic lock on the buffer, so that the buffer cannot be modified while the
computation takes place. This value should be cached when reading out the contents of the buffer,
so that as small a time as possible is spent in an atomic lock.

Note, that the value returned by this function is guaranteed to only be the minimum number of bytes
stored in the given buffer; this value may change as other threads write new data, thus
the returned number should be used only to determine how many successive reads may safely
be performed on the buffer.

|Buffer| is a pointer to a ring buffer structure whose count is to be computed.

Returns number of bytes currently stored in the buffer.

@ Retrieves the free space in a particular buffer. This value is computed by entering an atomic
lock on the buffer, so that the buffer cannot be modified while the computation takes place.

Note, that the value returned by this function is guaranteed to only be the maximum number of bytes
free in the given buffer; this value may change as other threads write new data, thus
the returned number should be used only to determine how many successive writes may safely
be performed on the buffer when there is a single writer thread.

@ Atomically determines if the specified ring buffer contains any data. This should
be tested before removing data from the buffer, to ensure that the buffer does not
underflow.

If the data is to be removed in a loop, store the total number of bytes stored in the
buffer (via a call to the |RingBuffer_GetCount| function) in a temporary variable
to reduce the time spent in atomicity locks.
