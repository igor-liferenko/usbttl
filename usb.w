@** Data throughput, latency and handshaking issues.
The Universal Serial Bus may be new to some users and developers. Here are
described the major architecture differences that need to be considered by both software and
hardware designers when changing from a traditional RS232 based solution to one that uses
the USB to serial interface devices.

@* The need for handshaking.
USB data transfer is prone to delays that do not normally appear in systems that have been used
to transferring data using interrupts. The original COM ports of a PC were directly connected
to the
motherboard and were interrupt driven. When a character was transmitted or received (depending
if FIFO's are used) the CPU would be interrupted and go to a routine to handle the data. This
meant that a user could be reasonably certain that, given a particular baud rate and data rate,
the
transfer of data could be achieved without any real need for flow control. The hardware interrupt
ensured that the request would get serviced. Therefore data could be transferred without using
handshaking and still arrive into the PC without data loss.

@* Data transfer comparison.
USB does not transfer data using interrupts. It uses a scheduled system and as a result, there can
be periods when the USB request does not get scheduled and, if handshaking is not used, data
loss will occur. An example of scheduling delays can be seen if an open application is dragged
around using the mouse.

For a USB device, data transfer is done in packets. If data is to be sent from the PC, then a
packet
of data is built up by the device driver and sent to the USB scheduler. This scheduler puts the
request onto the list of tasks for the USB host controller to perform. This will typically take
at least
1 millisecond to execute because it will not pick up the new request until the next 'USB Frame'
(the
frame period is 1 millisecond). Therefore there is a sizable overhead (depending on your required
throughput) associated with moving the data from the application to the USB device. If data were
sent 'a byte at a time' by an application, this would severely limit the overall throughput of the
system as a whole.

@* Continuous data --- smoothing the lumps.
Data is received from USB to the PC by a polling method. The driver will request a certain amount
of data from the USB scheduler. This is done in multiples of 64 bytes. The 'bulk packet size' on
USB is a maximum of 64 bytes. The host controller will read data from the device until either:

a) a packet shorter than 64 bytes is received or
b) the requested data length is reached

The device driver will request packet sizes between 64 Bytes and 4 Kbytes. The size of the packet
will affect the performance and is dependent on the data rate. For very high speed, the largest
packet size is needed. For 'real-time' applications that are transferring audio data at 115200 Baud
for example, the smallest packet possible is desirable, otherwise the device will be holding up
4k of
data at a time. This can give the effect of 'jerky' data transfer if the USB request size is too
large
and the data rate too low (relatively).

@* Small amounts of data or end of buffer conditions.
When transferring data from a USB-Serial or USB-FIFO IC device to the PC, the device will
send the data given one of the following conditions:

1. The buffer is full (64 bytes made up of 2 status bytes and 62 user bytes).

2. One of the RS232 status lines has changed (USB-Serial chips only). A change of level (high
or low) on CTS\# / DSR\# / DCD\# or RI\# will cause it to pass back the current buffer even
though it may be empty or have less than 64 bytes in it.

3. An event character had been enabled and was detected in the incoming data stream.

4. A timer integral to the chip has timed out. There is a timer (latency timer) in some
chips that measures the time since data was last
sent to the PC. The default value of the timer is set to 16 milliseconds.
The value of the timer is adjustable from 1 to 255 milliseconds.
Every time data is
sent back to the PC the timer is reset. If it times-out then the chip will send back the 2 status
bytes and any data that is held in the buffer.

From this it can be seen that small amounts of data (or the end of large amounts of data), will be
subject to a 16 millisecond delay when transferring into the PC. This delay should be taken along
with the delays associated with the USB request size as mentioned in the previous section. The
timer value was chosen so that we could make advantage of 64 byte packets to fill large buffers
when in high speed mode, as well as letting single characters through. Since the value chosen for
the latency timer is 16 milliseconds, this means that it will take 16 milliseconds to receive an
individual character, over and above the transfer time on serial or parallel link.

For large amounts of data, at high data rates, the timer will not be used. It may be used to send
the last packet of a block, if the final packet size works out to be less than 64 bytes. The
first 2
bytes of every packet are used as status bytes for the driver. This status is sent every 16
milliseconds, even when no data is present in the device.

A worst case condition could occur when 62 bytes of data are received in 16 milliseconds. This
would not cause a timeout, but would send the 64 bytes (2 status + 62 user data bytes) back to
USB every 16 milliseconds. When the USB driver receives the 64 bytes it would hold on
to them and request another 'IN' transaction. This would be completed another 16 milliseconds
later and so on until USB driver gets all of the 4K of data required. The overall time would
be (4096 / 64) * 16 milliseconds = 1.024 seconds between data packets being received by the
application. In
order to stop the data arriving in 4K packets, it should be requested in smaller amounts. A short
packet (< 64 bytes) will of course cause the data to pass from USB driver back to the chip
driver for
use by the application.

For application programmers it must be stressed that data should be sent or received using buffers
and not individual characters.

@** Effect of USB buffer size and the latency timer on data throughput.
An effect that is not immediately obvious is the way the size of the USB total packet request
has on
the smoothness of data flow. When a read request is sent to USB, the USB host controller will
continue to read 64 byte packets until one of the following conditions is met:

1. It has read the requested size (default is 4 Kbytes).

2. It has received a packet shorter than 64 bytes from the chip.

3. It has been cancelled.

While the host controller is waiting for one of the above conditions to occur, NO data is
received by
our driver and hence the user's application. The data, if there is any, is only finally
transferred after
one of the above conditions has occurred.

Normally condition 3 will not occur so we will look at cases 1 and 2. If 64 byte packets are
continually sent back to the host, then it will continue to read the data to match the block size
requested before it sends the block back to the driver. If a small amount of data is sent, or the
data is sent slowly, then the latency timer will take over and send a short packet back to the host
which will terminate the read request. The data that has been read so far is then passed on to the
users application via the chip driver. This shows a relationship between the latency timer,
the data
rate and when the data will become available to the user. A condition can occur where if data is
passed into the chip at such a rate as to avoid the latency timer timing out, it can take a long
time between receiving data blocks. This occurs because the host controller will see 64 byte
packets at the point just before the end of the latency period and will therefore continue to
read the
data until it reaches the block size before it is passed back to the user's application.

The rate that causes this will be:

62 / Latency Timer bytes/Second

(2 bytes per 64 byte packet are used for status)

For the default values: -

62 / 0.016 ~= 3875 bytes /second ~= 38.75 KBaud

Therefore if data is received at a rate of 3875 bytes per second (38.75 KBaud) or faster, then the
data will be subject to delays based on the requested USB block length. If data is received at a
slower rate, then there will be less than 62 bytes (64 including our 2 status bytes) available
after 16
milliseconds. Therefore a short packet will occur, thus terminating the USB request and passing
the data back. At the limit condition of 38.75 KBaud it will take approximately 1.06 seconds
between data buffers into the users application (assuming a 4Kbyte USB block request buffer size).

To get around this you can either increase the latency timer or reduce the USB block request.
Reducing the USB block request is the preferred method though a balance between the 2 may be
sought for optimum system response.

USB Transfer (buffer) size can be adjusted in the chip. Transmit buffer and receive buffer
are separate. TODO: read Dimitrov's arduino forum thread about this.
@^TODO@>

The size of the USB block requested can be adjusted in the chip.

@* Event Characters.
If the event character is enabled and it is detected in the data stream, then the contents of the
devices buffer is sent immediately. The event character is not stripped out of the data stream by
the device or by the drivers, it is up to the application to remove it. Event characters may
be turned
on and off depending on whether large amounts of random data or small command sequences are
to be sent. The event character will not work if it is the first character in the buffer. It
needs to be
the second or higher. The reason for this being applications that use the Internet for example,
will
program the event character as `\$7E'. All the data is then sent and received in packets that have
`\$7E' at the start and at the end of the packet. In order to maximise throughput and to avoid a
packet with only the starting `\$7E' in it, the event character does not trigger on the first
position.

@* Flushing the receive buffer using the modem status lines.
Flow control can be used by some chips to flush
the buffer in the chip. Changing one of the modem status lines will do this. The modem status
lines can be controlled by an external device or from the host PC itself. If an unused output line
(DTR) is connected to one of the unused inputs (DSR), then if the DTR line is changed by the
application program from low to high or high to low, this will cause a change on DSR and make it
flush the buffer.

@* Flow Control.
Some chips use their own handshaking as an
integral part of its design, by proper use of the TXE\# line. Such chips can use RTS/CTS,
DTR/DSR hardware or XOn/XOff software handshaking.
It is highly recommended that some form of handshaking be used.

There are 4 methods of flow control that can be programmed for some devices.

1. None - this may result in data loss at high speeds

2. RTS/CTS - 2 wire handshake. The device will transmit if CTS is active and will drop RTS if it
cannot receive any more.

3. DTR/DSR - 2 wire handshake. The device will transmit if DSR is active and will drop DTR if it
cannot receive any more.

4. XON/XOFF - flow control is done by sending or receiving special characters. One is XOn
(transmit on) the other is XOff (transmit off). They are individually programmable to any value.

It is strongly encouraged that flow control is used because it is impossible to ensure that the
chip
driver will always be scheduled. The chip can buffer up to 384 bytes of data. Kernel can 'starve'
the driver program of time if it is doing other things. The most obvious example of this is moving
an application around the screen with the mouse by grabbing its task bar. This will result in a lot
of
graphics activity and data loss will occur if receiving data at 115200 baud (as an example) with no
handshaking. If the data rate is low or data loss is acceptable then flow control may be omitted.

@ Setting |U2X1| bit will reduce the divisor of the baud rate divider from 16 to 8,
effectively doubling the transfer rate. Note however that the Receiver will in this
case only use half the number of samples (reduced from 16 to 8) for data sampling
and clock recovery, and therefore a more accurate baud rate setting and system
clock are required when this mode is used. For the Transmitter, there are no downsides.

Using a CPU clock of 4 MHz, 9600 Bd can be achieved with an acceptable
tolerance without setting \.{U2X} (prescaler 25), while 38400 Bd
require \.{U2X} to be set (prescaler 12).

The USART Baud Rate Register (UBRR) and the down-counter connected to it functions
as a programmable prescaler or baud rate generator. The down-counter, running at
system clock ($F_{OSC}$), is loaded with the UBRR value each time the counter has counted
down to zero or when the UBRRL Register is written. A clock is generated each time
the counter reaches zero.

This clock is the baud rate generator clock output (= $F_{OSC}/(UBRR+1)$). The
transmitter divides the baud rate generator clock output by 2, 8, or 16 depending
on mode. The baud rate generator output is used directly by the receiver's clock
and data recovery units.

Below are the equations for calculating baud rate and UBRR value:

@ Enable internal 3.3V USB data pad regulator to regulate the voltage of the D+/D- pads,
which must be within a 3.0-3.6V range.

PLL (Phase-Locked Loop) is used to generate the high frequency clock that the USB controller
requires.
Modern SoCs use PLL to generate (almost) any clock that might be needed for
interfaces. In simplified terms, the PLL circuit employs a high-frequency VCO
(Voltage-controlled oscillator), then uses difital frequency dividers on both VCO and
input clock, and generates a voltage feedback based on the frequency ratio. This feedback
controls the VCO, such that the entire loop is locked to the desired frequency.
Set |PINDIV| to configure the PLL input prescaler to generate the 8MHz input clock for the
PLL from 16 MHz clock source.
When the |PLLE| is set, the PLL is started.
Note, that PLL internal VCO clock reference is 48 MHz by default.
Output from PLL to USB controller is 48 MHz.

Host port activates VBUS (+5V).
The voltage source on the pull-up resistor for D+ line is taken from VBUS (section 7.1.7.4
in USB spec).
When host port detects the pull-up, it asserts
|USB_RESET| state on the bus, driving both D+ and D- lines to ground (section 7.1.7.5
of USB spec).
Device waits until the end of |USB_RESET|.
After that the host will send a |REQ_GET_DESCRIPTOR|
command using a default address and then device will send a packet of bytes with the descriptor
length and the actual descriptor with which the device identifies itself. Then the host resets
the device and sends a unique address
(|REQ_SET_ADDRESS|) before getting the configuration and interface descriptors.
Device must be able to accept a ``set address'' request (refer to
Section 9.4 of USB spec) after the reset recovery time 10 ms
after the reset is removed. Failure to accept this request may cause the device not
to be recognized by the USB system software.
The reset signaling must be driven for a minimum of 10ms, and it
is required that resets from root ports (i.e., not hubs) have a duration of at least 50 ms.
It is not required that this be 50 ms of continuous Reset signaling. However, if the
reset is not continuous, the interval(s) between reset signaling must be less than 3 ms,
and the duration of each SE0 assertion must be at least 10 ms.
A device that sees an SE0 on its upstream facing port for more than $2.5 \mu s$
may treat that signal as a reset. The reset must have taken effect before the reset signaling ends.
Device must be able to accept a SetAddress() request after the reset recovery time 10 ms after
the reset is removed. Failure to accept this request may cause the device not to be recognized by
the USB system software.
The USB System Software guarantees a minimum of 10 ms for reset recovery. Device
response to any bus transactions addressed to the default device address during the reset
recovery time is undefined.
So, timing is critical. This is why |EORSTE| is used.

@ FLASH buffer source version of |Endpoint_Write_Control_Stream_LE|.

The FLASH data must be located in the first 64KB of FLASH for this function to work correctly.

This function automatically sends the last packet in the data stage of the transaction;
when the function returns, the user is responsible for clearing the
status stage of the transaction.
Note that the status stage packet is sent or received in the opposite direction of the data flow.

This routine should only be used on CONTROL type endpoints.

Unlike the standard stream read/write commands, the control stream commands cannot be
chained together; i.e. the entire stream data must be read or written at the one time.

|Buffer| -- pointer to the source data buffer to read from.
|Length| -- number of bytes to read for the currently selected endpoint into the buffer.

@** USB.
The USB functionality.

@* Core driver for the microcontroller hardware USB module.

@*1 Driver and framework for the USB controller.
The USB stack requires the sole control over the USB controller in the microcontroller
only; i.e. it does not
require any additional timers or other peripherals to operate. This ensures that the USB
stack requires as few
resources as possible.

Here the USB stack is used in Device Mode for connections to USB Hosts.

@*2 USB Class Drivers.
Driver for the standardized CDC USB device class.

Class drivers give a framework which sits on top of the low level library API,
allowing for standard
USB classes to be implemented in a project with minimal user code.

These drivers can
be used in
conjunction with the library low level APIs to implement interfaces both via the
class drivers and via
the standard library APIs.

Multiple device mode class drivers can be used within a project, including multiple
instances of the
same class driver. In this way, USB Hosts and Devices can be made quickly using the
internal class drivers
so that more time and effort can be put into the end application instead of the USB protocol.

CDC-ACM class driver is used here.

@*1 Using the Class Drivers.
To make the Class drivers easy to integrate into a user application, they all
implement a standardized
design with similarly named/used function, enums, defines and types. The two different
modes are implemented
slightly differently, and thus will be explained separately. For information on a
specific class driver, read
the class driver's module documentation.

@*2 Device Mode Class Drivers.
Implementing a Device Mode Class Driver in a user application requires a number of steps
to be followed. Firstly,
the module configuration and state structure must be added to the project source.
These structures are named in a
similar manner between classes, that of |USB_ClassInfo_CDC_Device_t|,
and are used to hold the
complete state and configuration for each class instance. Multiple class instances is
where the power of the class
drivers lie; multiple interfaces of the same class simply require more instances of the
Class Driver's \&{USB\_ClassInfo\_*}
structure.

Inside the ClassInfo structure lies two sections, a |Config| section, and a
|State| section. The |Config| section contains the instance's configuration parameters.

@ LUFA CDC Class driver interface configuration and state information.
This structure is
passed to all CDC Class driver functions, so that multiple instances of the same class
within a device can be differentiated from one another.

Initialize instance (i.e., set \\{Config} field) of the CDC Class Driver structure.

Note, that the class driver's configuration parameters should match those used in the
device's descriptors that are sent to the host.

@<Global...@>=
USB_ClassInfo_CDC_Device_t VirtualSerial_CDC_Interface = {@|
  @<Initialize \\{Config} field of |USB_ClassInfo_CDC_Device_t|@>@/
};

@ @<Initialize \\{Config} field of |USB_ClassInfo_CDC_Device_t|@>= {@|
  INTERFACE_ID_CDC_CCI, @|
  {@, CDC_TX_EPADDR, CDC_TXRX_EPSIZE, 1 @,}, @|
  {@, CDC_RX_EPADDR, CDC_TXRX_EPSIZE, 1 @,}, @|
  {@, CDC_NOTIFICATION_EPADDR, CDC_NOTIFICATION_EPSIZE, 1 @,} @/
}

@ To initialize the Class driver instance, the driver's
|CDC_Device_ConfigureEndpoints| function
should be called in response to the |EVENT_USB_Device_ConfigurationChanged| event.
This function will return a
boolean true value if the driver successfully initialized the instance. Like all the
class driver functions, this function
takes in the address of the specific instance you wish to initialize
(this was done to be able to initialize multiple separate instances of the same class
type).

Event handler for USB configuration number change event.
This event fires when a the USB host changes the
selected configuration number while in device mode. This event should be hooked in device
applications to create the endpoints and configure the device for the selected configuration.

This event is time-critical; exceeding OS-specific delays within this event handler
(typically of around
one second) will prevent the device from enumerating correctly.

This event fires after the value of |USB_Device_ConfigurationNumber| has been changed.

@<Func...@>=
void EVENT_USB_Device_ConfigurationChanged(void);

@ @c
void EVENT_USB_Device_ConfigurationChanged(void)
{
  if (CDC_Device_ConfigureEndpoints(&VirtualSerial_CDC_Interface)) /* USB interface is ready */
    PORTD &= ~(1 << PD5); /* led off */
}

@ Once initialized, it is important to maintain the CDC class instance state by repeatedly
calling the Class Driver's |CDC_Device_USBTask| function in the main program loop.
It needs to be called before |@<Manage control endpoint@>|.

}

@ Class driver also defines a callback function |CALLBACK_USB_GetDescriptor|.
In addition, each class
driver may
also define a set of events (identifiable by their prefix of \\{EVENT\_*} in the
function's name), which
the user application may choose to implement, or ignore if not needed.

{\emergencystretch=2cm The individual Device Mode Class Driver documentation contains more
information on the
non-standardized,
class-specific functions which the user application can then use on the driver instances,
such as data
read and write routines. See each driver's individual documentation for more information
on the
class-specific functions.\par}

descriptor. Normally this reduces the amount of configuration required for the library, allows
the value to change dynamically (if descriptors are stored in EEPROM or RAM rather than flash
memory) and reduces code maintenance. However, this token can be defined to a non-zero value
instead to give the size in bytes of the control endpoint, to reduce the size of the compiled
binary.

@ Global indicating the maximum packet size of the default control endpoint located at address
0 in the device. This value is set to the value indicated in the device descriptor in the user
project once the USB interface is initialized into device mode.

If space is an issue, it is possible to fix this to a static value by defining the control
endpoint size in the |FIXED_CONTROL_ENDPOINT_SIZE| token passed to the compiler in the
makefile
via the -D switch. When a fixed control endpoint size is used, the size is no longer
dynamically
read from the descriptors at runtime and instead fixed to the given value. When used, it is
important that the descriptor control endpoint size value matches the size given as the
|FIXED_CONTROL_ENDPOINT_SIZE| token - it is recommended that the
|FIXED_CONTROL_ENDPOINT_SIZE| token
be used in the device descriptors to ensure this.

@* USBTask.
Main USB service task management.

This contains the function definitions required for the main USB service task,
which must be called to ensure that the USB connection to a connected USB device
is maintained.

@ Structure containing the last received Control request.

@<Global variables@>=
USB_Request_Header_t USB_ControlRequest;

@ One of the most frequently used global variables in the stack is the |USB_DeviceState|
global, which indicates the current state of the Device State Machine. To reduce the
amount of code and time required to access and modify this global in an application,
|DEVICE_STATE_AS_GPIOR| may be defined to a value between 0 and 2 to fix the state
variable into one of the three general purpose IO registers inside the AVR reserved
for application use. So as it is defined, the corresponding |GPIOR| register should
not be used within the user application except implicitly via the library APIs.

@d DEVICE_STATE_AS_GPIOR 0

@<Macros@>=
#define CONCAT(x, y)            x ## y
#define CONCAT_EXPANDED(x, y)   CONCAT(x, y)
#define USB_DeviceState CONCAT_EXPANDED(GPIOR, DEVICE_STATE_AS_GPIOR) /* expands into
  |(*(volatile uint8_t *)((0x1E) + 0x20))| */

@* USB Event management.
This contains macros and functions relating to the management of library events, which
are small
pieces of code similar to ISRs which are run when a given condition is met. Each event
can be fired from
multiple places in the user or library code, which may or may not be inside an ISR, thus
each handler
should be written to be as small and fast as possible to prevent possible problems.

Events can be hooked by the user application by declaring a handler function with the
same name and parameters
listed here. If an event with no user-associated handler is fired within the library,
it by default maps to an
internal empty stub function.

Each event must only have one associated event handler, but can be raised by multiple
sources by calling the
event handler function (with any required event parameters).

@* StdDescriptors.
Common standard USB Descriptor definitions.
Standard USB device descriptor defines and retrieval routines. This contains
structures and macros for the easy creation of standard USB descriptors.

@ Indicates that a given descriptor does not exist in the device. This can be used inside
descriptors for string descriptor indexes, or may be use as a return value for
|CALLBACK_USB_GetDescriptor| when
the specified descriptor does not exist.

@<Macros@>=
#define NO_DESCRIPTOR 0

@ Macro to calculate the power value for the configuration descriptor, from a given number
of milliamperes.
Parameter is maximum number of milliamps the device consumes when the given
configuration is selected.

@<Macros@>=
#define USB_CONFIG_POWER_MA(mA) ((mA) >> 1)

@ Macro to calculate the Unicode length of a string with a given number of Unicode characters.
Should be used in string descriptor's headers for giving the string descriptor's byte length.

Parameter is number of Unicode characters in the string text.

@<Macros@>=
#define USB_STRING_LEN(UnicodeChars) (sizeof (USB_Descriptor_Header_t) + ((UnicodeChars) << 1))

@ Convenience macro to easily create |USB_Descriptor_String_t| instances from a wide
character string.

  }, \
  String \
}

@ Macro to encode a given major/minor/revision version number into Binary Coded Decimal
format for descriptor
fields requiring BCD encoding, such as the USB version number in the standard device
descriptor.

Note, that this value is automatically converted into Little Endian, suitable for direct use
inside device descriptors without endianness conversion macros.

Parameters are: major version number to encode, minor version number to encode,
revision version number to encode.

@<Macros@>=
#define VERSION_BCD(Major, Minor, Revision) \
                                          ((Major & 0xFF) << 8) | \

@* CDC Class driver.

There are several major drawbacks to the CDC-ACM standard USB class, however
it is very standardized and thus usually available as a built-in driver on
most platforms, and so is a better choice than a proprietary serial class.

One major issue with CDC-ACM is that it requires two Interface descriptors,
which will upset most hosts when part of a multi-function "Composite" USB
device. This is because each interface will be loaded into a separate driver
instance, causing the two interfaces be become unlinked. To prevent this, you
should use the "Interface Association Descriptor" addendum to the USB 2.0 standard
which is available on most OSes when creating Composite devices.

Another major oversight is that there is no mechanism for the host to notify the
device that there is a data sink on the host side ready to accept data. This
means that the device may try to send data while the host isn't listening, causing
lengthy blocking timeouts in the transmission routines. It is thus highly recommended
that the virtual serial line DTR (Data Terminal Ready) signal be used where possible
to determine if a host application is ready for data.

@** RingBuffer.
Lightweight ring (circular) buffer, for fast insertion/deletion of bytes.

Lightweight ring buffer, for fast insertion/deletion. Multiple buffers can be created of
different sizes to suit different needs.

Note that for each buffer, insertion and removal operations may occur at the same time (via
a multi-threaded ISR based system) however the same kind of operation (two or more insertions
or deletions) must not overlap. If there is possibility of two or more of the same kind of
operating occurring at the same point in time, atomic (mutex) locking should be used.

@ Ring Buffer Management Structure.

Type define for a new ring buffer object. Buffers should be initialized via a call to
|RingBuffer_InitBuffer| before use.

@s RingBuffer_t int

@ Forces GCC to use pointer indirection (via the device's pointer register pairs) when
accessing the given
struct pointer. In some cases GCC will emit non-optimal assembly code when accessing
a structure through
a pointer, resulting in a larger binary. When this macro is used on a (non |const|)
structure pointer before
use, it will force GCC to use pointer indirection on the elements rather than direct
store and load instructions.

|StructPtr| is pointer to a structure which is to be forced into indirect
access mode.

before any operations are called upon them. Already initialized buffers may be reset
by re-initializing them using this function.

@ Retrieves the current number of bytes stored in a particular buffer. This value is computed
by entering an atomic lock on the buffer, so that the buffer cannot be modified while the
computation takes place. This value should be cached when reading out the contents of the buffer,
so that as small a time as possible is spent in an atomic lock.

Note, that the value returned by this function is guaranteed to only be the minimum number of bytes
stored in the given buffer; this value may change as other threads write new data, thus
the returned number should be used only to determine how many successive reads may safely
be performed on the buffer.

@ Retrieves the free space in a particular buffer. This value is computed by entering an atomic
lock on the buffer, so that the buffer cannot be modified while the computation takes place.

Note, that the value returned by this function is guaranteed to only be the maximum number of bytes
free in the given buffer; this value may change as other threads write new data, thus
the returned number should be used only to determine how many successive writes may safely
be performed on the buffer when there is a single writer thread.

@ Atomically determines if the specified ring buffer contains any data. This should
be tested before removing data from the buffer, to ensure that the buffer does not
underflow.

If the data is to be removed in a loop, store the total number of bytes stored in the
buffer (via a call to the |RingBuffer_GetCount| function) in a temporary variable
to reduce the time spent in atomicity locks.
