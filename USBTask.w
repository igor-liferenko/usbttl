			 *

			 *  The task may be serviced at all times, or (for minimum CPU consumption)
			 *   it may be disabled at start-up, enabled on the firing of the \ref EVENT_USB_Device_Connect()
			 *      event and disabled again on the firing of the \ref EVENT_USB_Device_Disconnect() event.

			 *  The control endpoint can instead be managed via interrupts entirely by the library
			 *  by defining the INTERRUPT_CONTROL_ENDPOINT token and passing it to the compiler via the -D switch.
